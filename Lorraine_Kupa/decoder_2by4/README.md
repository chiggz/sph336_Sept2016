This is a 2-by-4 decoder example, which is a makefile project and so no need for an IDE. 
Just cd into this folder and run the command 

    make decoder


A line decoder is a device that changes the input code into a set of signals.<br>
It takes an n-digit binary number and decodes it into 4<sup>n</sup> data lines.
It does the reverse of encoding. <br>
In the following truth table, the output D0 is high when both inputs are zero,  the output D1 is high when the input A is 0 and input B is 1,  the output D2 is high when the input A is 1 and input B is 0,  the output D3 is high when both inputs are 1. it decodes a single digit binary number.
